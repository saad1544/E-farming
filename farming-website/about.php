            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>Founded in 2010, Organic Farming began with a simple mission: to provide fresh, chemical-free produce to our local community. What started as a small family farm has grown into a trusted source for organic fruits and vegetables.</p>
            
            <h2>Our Methods</h2>
            <p>We use sustainable farming practices that respect the environment:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>No synthetic pesticides or fertilizers</li>
                <li>Crop rotation for soil health</li>
                <li>Natural pest control methods</li>
                <li>Water conservation techniques</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Meet Our Team</h2>
            <p>Our dedicated farmers bring years of experience and passion to every crop we grow. We believe in hands-on care from planting to harvest.</p>
